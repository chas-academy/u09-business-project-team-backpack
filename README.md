- **Centralized information source** - All country information in one place
- **Personal collections** - Users can save their favorite countries and create custom lists
- **Search and filtering functions** - Easy to find specific countries or regions
- **Updated data** - Information from REST Countries API that stays current
- **User-friendly interface** - Intuitive design for all age groups
